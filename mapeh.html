        <h1>VOLLEYBALL</h1>
        <img src="volleyball.png" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;">
        <p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Rules of Volleyball</h2>
        <p>Each team gets a maximum of three touches before sending the ball over the net.</p>
        <p>Players cannot hit the ball twice consecutively.</p> 
        <p>The ball cannot be held or carried.</p>  
        <p>Stepping over the centerline is a fault.</p>
        <p>A player cannot block or attack the opponent's serve.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Court Dimensions</h2>
        <img src="court.png" style="width: 400px; height: 600px;">
        <p>A volleyball court is 9 m x 18 m, divided into equal square halves by a net with a width of one meter. The top of the net is 2.43 m above the center of the court for men's competition, and 2.24 m for women's competition, varied for veterans and junior competitions.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Basic Skills</h2>
        <p><strong>Serve:</strong> Starts the game by hitting the ball over the net from behind the service line. Can be underhand or overhand.</p>
        <p><strong>Pass:</strong> Receives the opponent's serve using forearms to control the ball and send it to a teammate.</p>
        <p><strong>Dig:</strong> Defensive technique to save a hard-driven ball from hitting the ground.</p>
        <p><strong>Set:</strong> Sets up the ball for an attack by using an open-handed touch to place it in a high, predictable location for a teammate to hit.</p>
        <p><strong>Spike:</strong> Jumps and forcefully hits the ball towards the opponent's court with the aim to score a point.</p>
        <p><strong>Block:</strong> Players jump near the net to deflect the opponent's attack attempt.</p>
